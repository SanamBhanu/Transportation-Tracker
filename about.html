  No more getting caught in the rain waiting for the bus!No more scratching your head and wondering if you had missed the bus!No more guessing when the next bus will arrive.The DhBus schedule takes the guess work out of catching the bus(in Dharwad).It uses the data given by the Transport Corporation of Government.It also provides extra information about the routes between "From" and "To" places .It is very simple and intuitive to use.Best of all,it is absolutely FREE!!!
